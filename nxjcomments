Have you disabled hibernation? If not use this command :)

sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0

After using those commands I tried to put it to sleep, but it is showing the same behaviour as before.

First it turns of the screens, then the keyboard goes dark, then the Powerbutton starts to fade and after about 5 seconds it turns back on the keyboard and seems to be waking up again, but then the display stays dark.

Can you tell me your BIOS-Version, I recently did a downgrade since it froze after roughly 5 minutes on battery power, after the downgrade it seemed to be ok.

Do you have any tips?
